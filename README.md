# MIT 6.100L: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (Fall 2022)

## ðŸ“š About This Course

This repository documents my self-study of [MIT 6.100L](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/), an introductory course in computer science and Python programming offered by MIT OpenCourseWare (Fall 2022).

Although I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in IT at VAMK (Vaasan ammattikorkeakoulu, Finland), the curriculum does not include Python. To better prepare for further study, especially in algorithms and data structures (such as MIT's 6.006), I took the initiative to complete this course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Gain a solid foundation in Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
- Become familiar with Python's control flow, functions, recursion, and object-oriented programming.
- Build a foundation for future algorithm-related coursework (e.g. MIT 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms).

## âœ… Progress

- I have reviewed all lectures and key topics.
- I did not complete all assignments, as I already have prior programming experience and focused mainly on mastering the syntax and concepts necessary for future algorithm courses.

---

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Variables and expressions
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and recursion
- Strings, lists, dictionaries
- Classes and objects
- Testing and debugging
- Algorithmic thinking (introductory level)

## ðŸ“Œ Why I Took This Course

- My university (VAMK) does not offer Python in the curriculum.
- MIT's algorithms course (6.006) uses Python as the teaching language.
- I believe understanding Python is essential for algorithm competitions, technical interviews, and writing clean, readable code.
